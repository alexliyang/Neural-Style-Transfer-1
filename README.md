# Neural-Style-Transfer

I have used Keras with Tensorflow backend to do the Style Transfer. The entire code is in the jupyter notebook.

The style and the content images can be found in the examples folders along with the results(in a GIF format).

I have written a blog post explaining all the things that were done in the code.
